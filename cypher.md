MERGE (s2:Student{name:'Bob'}) CREATE (s2) - [:TAKES] -> (course:Course{title:'Machine Learning', code:'c2'})

CREATE (s3:Student{name:'Tom'})

## now the hunt is on
match (s1:Student {name:'Tom'}) - [:TAKES] -> (s1) RETURN (s1)

## find people who took the same course as Tom
match (s1:Student {name:'Tom'}) - [:TAKES] -> (c2) <- [:TAKES] - (s) RETURN (s)

## find courses taken by the people who took same course as Tom
match (s3:Student {name:'Tom'}) - [:TAKES] -> (c2) <- [:TAKES] - (s2) - [:TAKES] -> (p3) RETURN p3

## find departments that belong to courses taken by Tom
