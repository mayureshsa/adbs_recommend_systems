## Course Recommendation System

A simple python script to save sample course catalog data to MongoDB.

The script pulls data from the the json file (courses.json) and uses the Python [faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) library to generate fake student profile information, courses taken, and grades.

### MongoDB Schema

The script creates several MongoDB collections, such as `course`, `student`, and `course_taken`. 

#### `course` collection

Documents in the `course` collection represent an individual course being offered.

Example:

~~~
{
	"_id": "1",
    	"course_code": "INF-3792",
    	"university": "University of Troms√∏",
    	"course_name": "Medical Informatics",
    	"course_semester": "Spring2019"
}
~~~

#### `student` collection

Documents in this collection represent an individual student. Note that all information is randomly generated.

Example:

~~~
{
	"_id":"60",
	"name":"Keith Bell",
	"address":"01392 Bennett Wells Apt. 155\nEast Jamestown, CO 67641",
	"phone":"001-461-378-7716x5055"
}
~~~

#### `course_taken` collection

Documents in this collection correspond to a course taken by a student. The document in this collection aim to generate the property graphs in the Neo4j database (Note - the implementation is still in progress. Hence, the structure of documents in this collection may change)

Example:

~~~
{
	"_id":"5c8fe723b7f1f13fecd408f6",
	"student_id":"60",
	"student_name":"Keith Bell",
	"course_id":"6","grade":"D"
}
~~~
